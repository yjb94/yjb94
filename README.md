### üç≠ Thoughtful and meticulous developer
Welcome to my place :)

As a frontend engineer specializing in React, I'm dedicated to crafting efficient code solutions that minimize redundancy and maximize productivity.
From subtle interactions to phenomenal transitions, I strive to deliver frontend magic to users.

I also enjoy exploring and sharing my personal insights on the philosophy of development through thoughtful writing.
I like to learn new and cool things, share with my colleagues, and grow myself every single day.
